The minimum RTO for a single AZ will minimally be the time needed by AWS to achieve the failover mechanism when the primary database fails. As specify into AWS documentation, this amount of time can be up too two minutes. At this time should be added the eventual time taken by the system to complete any ongoing large transactions. The minimum RTO for a single region outage will be needed when the active region fails. In the best conditions, it will mostly be the time needed to promote the read replicate into an active instance + the reconfiguration of existing client to consider redirect all the write requests on this instance.

The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage will be identical to the minimum RTO for the similar reasons. The minimum RPO for a single region outage will be achieved when the active region fails and is likely to be the amount of time passed since the last backup and the moment the data loss is stopped.
