Because I wanted to be among those students who stand out I wanted to do the whole CloudFormation to setup the RDS.
After some research on internet, I found the links below where the author describes how to make it (with even an interesting way to handle the password).
So instead of doing the cloudformation, I just spent time reading amazon docs about the parameters he uses.

I haven't tried though for aws s3 -_-

Hope I will stand out still despite choosing the easy way :-) 

Regards.
